    <h3><b>About</b></h3>
    
<p><h4><em>Bookstore Order System</em></h4></p>
<p>C4U Books is an application designed exclusively for a local college and its 
faculty. Created from the ground up, C4U is a custom-built bookstore order 
management and inventory replenishment system that provides a secure, online 
ordering system for academic and store staff to place orders for their course 
materials each semester from multiple campuses.
</p>
<p>
Access levels, based on the user's role in accordance with the college, are 
established to ensure that orders cannot be manipulated or duplicated without 
proper access rights elevation, in addition to guaranteeing the privacy of all 
user information.
</p>

<p>
<h4><em>About The Creators</em></h4>

Ignacio Gonzalez, Rebecca Bowser, and Jonathan Sarasty. </p>
<p>
Over the course of three months in the summer of 2018, Code R’ Us came together 
to create a fully functioning, database driven application that has acted as our
Senior Capstone Project. </p>
<p>C4U Books is a dynamic showcasing of how unique skill sets working in harmony
can achieve new heights while prioritizing integrity and refusing to leave 
customer constraints in the dust, ultimately resulting in a superior product for
our client.
